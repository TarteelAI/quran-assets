And a party [of messengers] you denied and another party you killed.", "(88) And they said, \"Our hearts are wrapped.\"[33] But, [in fact], Allāh has cursed them for their disbelief, so little is it that they believe.", "(89) And when there came to them a Book [i.e., the Qur’ān] from Allāh confirming that which was with them - although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved - but [then] when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it; so the curse of Allāh will be upon the disbelievers.", "(90) How wretched is that for which they sold themselves - that they would disbelieve in what Allāh has revealed through [their] outrage that Allāh would send down His favor upon whom He wills from among His servants.

Then you took the calf [in worship] after that, while you were wrongdoers.", "(93) And [recall] when We took your covenant and raised over you the mount, [saying], \"Take what We have given you with determination and listen.\" They said [instead], \"We hear and disobey.\" And their hearts absorbed [the worship of] the calf because of their disbelief. Say, \"How wretched is that which your faith enjoins upon you, if you should be believers.\"", "(94) Say, [O Muḥammad], \"If the home of the Hereafter with Allāh is for you alone and not the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful.\"", "(95) But never will they wish for it, ever, because of what their hands have put forth. And Allāh is Knowing of the wrongdoers.", "(96) And you will surely find them the most greedy of people for life - [even] more than those who associate others with Allāh. One of them wishes that he could be granted life a thousand years, but it would not remove him in the least from the [coming] punishment that he should be granted life. And Allāh is Seeing of what they do.", "(97) Say, \"Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel - it is [none but] he who has brought it [i.e., the Qur’ān] down upon your heart, [O Muḥammad], by permission of Allāh, confirming that which was before it and as guidance and good tidings for the believers.\"", "(98) Whoever is an enemy to Allāh and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael - then indeed, Allāh is an enemy to the disbelievers.", "(99) And We have certainly revealed to you verses [which are] clear proofs, and no one would deny them except the defiantly disobedient.", "(100) Is it not [true] that every time they took a covenant a party of them threw it away? But, [in fact], most of them do not believe.", "(101) And when a messenger from Allāh came to them confirming that which was with them, a party of those who had been given the Scripture threw the Scripture of Allāh [i.e., the Torah] behind their backs as if they did not know [what it contained].", "(102) And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Hārūt and Mārūt. But they [i.e., the two angels] do not teach anyone unless they say, \"We are a trial, so do not disbelieve [by practicing magic].\"[34] And [yet] they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife. But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of Allāh. And they [i.e., people] learn what harms them and does not benefit them. But they [i.e., the Children of Israel] certainly knew that whoever purchased it [i.e., magic] would not have in the Hereafter any share. And wretched is that for which they sold themselves, if they only knew.", "(103) And if they had believed and feared Allāh, then the reward from Allāh would have been [far] better, if they only knew.", "(104) O you who have believed, say not [to Allāh's Messenger], \"Rāʿinā\" but say, \"Unẓurnā\"[35] and listen. And for the disbelievers is a painful punishment.", "(105) Neither those who disbelieve from the People of the Scripture [i.e., the Jews and Christians] nor the polytheists wish that any good should be sent down to you from your Lord. But Allāh selects for His mercy whom He wills, and Allāh is the possessor of great bounty.", "(106) We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it.

Indeed Allāh, of what you do, is Seeing.", "(111) And they say, \"None will enter Paradise except one who is a Jew or a Christian.\" That is [merely] their wishful thinking.

When Abraham said, \"My Lord is the one who gives life and causes death,\" he said, \"I give life and cause death.\" Abraham said, \"Indeed, Allāh brings up the sun from the east, so bring it up from the west.\" So the disbeliever was overwhelmed [by astonishment], and Allāh does not guide the wrongdoing people.", "(259) Or [consider such an example] as the one who passed by a township which had fallen into ruin.

Look at your food and your drink; it has not changed with time. And look at your donkey; and We will make you a sign for the people.

His example is like that of a [large] smooth stone upon which is dust and is hit by a downpour that leaves it bare. They are unable [to keep] anything of what they have earned. And Allāh does not guide the disbelieving people.", "(265) And the example of those who spend their wealth seeking means to the approval of Allāh and assuring [reward for] themselves is like a garden on high ground which is hit by a downpour - so it yields its fruits in double.

So whoever has received an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is past, and his affair rests with Allāh. But whoever returns [to dealing in interest or usury] - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide eternally therein.", "(276) Allāh destroys interest and gives increase for charities.

And bring to witness two witnesses from among your men. And if there are not two men [available], then a man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses - so that if one of them [i.e., the women] errs, then the other can remind her. And let not the witnesses refuse when they are called upon. And do not be [too] weary to write it, whether it is small or large, for its [specified] term. That is more just in the sight of Allāh and stronger as evidence and more likely to prevent doubt between you, except when it is an immediate transaction which you conduct among yourselves. For [then] there is no blame upon you if you do not write it. And take witnesses when you conclude a contract. Let no scribe be harmed or any witness. For if you do so, indeed, it is [grave] disobedience in you. And fear Allāh. And Allāh teaches you.

And sufficient is Hell as a blaze.", "(56) Indeed, those who disbelieve in Our verses - We will drive them into a fire. Every time their skins are roasted through, We will replace them with other skins so they may taste the punishment. Indeed, Allāh is ever Exalted in Might and Wise.", "(57) But those who believe and do righteous deeds - We will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide forever. For them therein are purified spouses, and We will admit them to deepening shade.", "(58) Indeed, Allāh commands you to render trusts to whom they are due and when you judge between people to judge with justice.

And whoever kills a believer by mistake - then the freeing of a believing slave and a compensation payment [diyah] presented to his [i.e., the deceased's] family [is required], unless they give [up their right as] charity. But if he [i.e., the deceased] was from a people at war with you and he was a believer - then [only] the freeing of a believing slave; and if he was from a people with whom you have a treaty - then a compensation payment presented to his family and the freeing of a believing slave.

So leave them and that which they invent.", "(138) And they say, \"These animals[349] and crops are forbidden; no one may eat from them except whom we will,\" by their claim.

And the [best] outcome is for the righteous.\"", "(129) They said, \"We have been harmed before you came to us and after you have come to us.\" He said, \"Perhaps your Lord will destroy your enemy and grant you succession in the land and see how you will do.\"", "(130) And We certainly seized[397] the people of Pharaoh with years of famine and a deficiency in fruits that perhaps they would be reminded.", "(131) But when good [i.e., provision] came to them, they said, \"This is ours [by right].\" And if a bad [condition] struck them, they saw an evil omen in Moses and those with him. Unquestionably, their fortune is with Allāh, but most of them do not know.", "(132) And they said, \"No matter what sign you bring us with which to bewitch us, we will not be believers in you.\"", "(133) So We sent upon them the flood and locusts and lice and frogs and blood as distinct signs, but they were arrogant and were a criminal people.", "(134) And when the punishment descended upon them, they said, \"O Moses, invoke for us your Lord by what He has promised you. If you [can] remove the punishment from us, we will surely believe you, and we will send with you the Children of Israel.\"", "(135) But when We removed the punishment from them until a term which they were to reach,[398] then at once they broke their word.", "(136) So We took retribution from them, and We drowned them in the sea because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them.", "(137) And We caused the people who had been oppressed to inherit the eastern regions of the land and the western ones, which We had blessed. And the good word [i.e., decree] of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of what they had patiently endured. And We destroyed [all] that Pharaoh and his people were producing and what they had been building.", "(138) And We took the Children of Israel across the sea; then they came upon a people intent in devotion to [some] idols of theirs. They [the Children of Israel] said, \"O Moses, make for us a god just as they have gods.\" He said, \"Indeed, you are a people behaving ignorantly.", "(139) Indeed, those [worshippers] - destroyed is that in which they are [engaged], and worthless is whatever they were doing.\"", "(140) He said, \"Is it other than Allāh I should desire for you as a god[399] while He has preferred you over the worlds?\"", "(141) And [recall, O Children of Israel], when We saved you from the people of Pharaoh, [who were] afflicting you with the worst torment - killing your sons and keeping your women alive. And in that was a great trial from your Lord.", "(142) And We made an appointment with Moses for thirty nights and perfected them by [the addition of] ten; so the term of his Lord was completed as forty nights. And Moses said to his brother Aaron, \"Take my place among my people, do right [by them],[400] and do not follow the way of the corrupters.\"", "(143) And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, \"My Lord, show me [Yourself] that I may look at You.\" [Allāh] said, \"You will not see Me,[401] but look at the mountain; if it should remain in place, then you will see Me.\" But when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He rendered it level,[402] and Moses fell unconscious. And when he awoke, he said, \"Exalted are You! I have repented to You, and I am the first [among my people] of the believers.\"[403]", "(144) [Allāh] said, \"O Moses, I have chosen you over the people with My messages and My words [to you]. So take what I have given you and be among the grateful.\"", "(145) And We wrote for him on the tablets [something] of all things - instruction and explanation for all things, [saying], \"Take them with determination and order your people to take the best of it. I will show you the home of the defiantly disobedient.\"[404]", "(146) I will turn away from My signs those who are arrogant upon the earth without right; and if they should see every sign, they will not believe in it. And if they see the way of consciousness,[405] they will not adopt it as a way; but if they see the way of error, they will adopt it as a way. That is because they have denied Our signs and they were heedless of them.", "(147) Those who denied Our signs and the meeting of the Hereafter - their deeds have become worthless. Are they recompensed except for what they used to do?", "(148) And the people of Moses made, after [his departure], from their ornaments a calf - an image having a lowing sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to a way? They took it [for worship], and they were wrongdoers.", "(149) And when regret overcame them[406] and they saw that they had gone astray, they said, \"If our Lord does not have mercy upon us and forgive us, we will surely be among the losers.\"", "(150) And when Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved, he said, \"How wretched is that by which you have replaced me after [my departure]. Were you impatient over the matter of your Lord?\" And he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by [the hair of] his head, pulling him toward him. [Aaron] said, \"O son of my mother, indeed the people overpowered me and were about to kill me, so let not the enemies rejoice over me[407] and do not place me among the wrongdoing people.\"", "(151) [Moses] said, \"My Lord, forgive me and my brother and admit us into Your mercy, for You are the most merciful of the merciful.\"", "(152) Indeed, those who took the calf [for worship] will obtain anger from their Lord and humiliation in the life of this world, and thus do We recompense the inventors [of falsehood].", "(153) But those who committed misdeeds and then repented after them and believed - indeed your Lord, thereafter, is Forgiving and Merciful.", "(154) And when the anger subsided in Moses, he took up the tablets; and in their inscription was guidance and mercy for those who are fearful of their Lord.", "(155) And Moses chose from his people seventy men for Our appointment.[408] And when the earthquake seized them,[409] he said, \"My Lord, if You had willed, You could have destroyed them before and me [as well]. Would You destroy us for what the foolish among us have done? This is not but Your trial by which You send astray whom You will and guide whom You will. You are our Protector, so forgive us and have mercy upon us; and You are the best of forgivers.", "(156) And decree for us in this world [that which is] good and [also] in the Hereafter; indeed, we have turned back to You.\" [Allāh] said, \"My punishment - I afflict with it whom I will, but My mercy encompasses all things.\" So I will decree it [especially] for those who fear Me and give zakāh and those who believe in Our verses-", "(157) Those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered prophet, whom they find written [i.e., described] in what they have of the Torah and the Gospel, who enjoins upon them what is right and prohibits them from what is wrong and makes lawful for them what is good and forbids them from what is evil and relieves them of their burden[410] and the shackles which were upon them.[411] So they who have believed in him, honored him, supported him and followed the light which was sent down with him - it is those who will be the successful.", "(158) Say, [O Muḥammad], \"O mankind, indeed I am the Messenger of Allāh to you all, [from Him] to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. There is no deity except Him; He gives life and causes death.\" So believe in Allāh and His Messenger, the unlettered prophet, who believes in Allāh and His words, and follow him that you may be guided.", "(159) And among the people of Moses is a community[412] which guides by truth and by it establishes justice.", "(160) And We divided them into twelve descendant tribes[413] [as distinct] nations. And We inspired to Moses when his people implored him for water, \"Strike with your staff the stone,\" and there gushed forth from it twelve springs. Every people [i.e., tribe] knew its watering place. And We shaded them with clouds and sent down upon them manna and quails, [saying], \"Eat from the good things with which We have provided you.\" And they wronged Us not, but they were [only] wronging themselves.", "(161) And [mention, O Muḥammad], when it was said to them, \"Dwell in this city [i.e., Jerusalem] and eat from it wherever you will and say, 'Relieve us of our burdens [i.e., sins],' and enter the gate bowing humbly; We will [then] forgive you your sins. We will increase the doers of good [in goodness and reward].\"", "(162) But those who wronged among them changed [the words] to a statement other than that which had been said to them. So We sent upon them a punishment from the sky for the wrong that they were doing.", "(163) And ask them about the town that was by the sea - when they transgressed in [the matter of] the sabbath - when their fish came to them openly on their sabbath day, and the day they had no sabbath they did not come to them. Thus did We give them trial because they were defiantly disobedient.", "(164) And when a community among them said, \"Why do you advise [or warn] a people whom Allāh is [about] to destroy or to punish with a severe punishment?\" they [the advisors] said, \"To be absolved before your Lord and perhaps they may fear Him.\"", "(165) And when they [i.e., those advised] forgot that by which they had been reminded, We saved those who had forbidden evil and seized those who wronged, with a wretched punishment, because they were defiantly disobeying.", "(166) So when they were insolent about that which they had been forbidden, We said to them, \"Be apes, despised.\"", "(167) And [mention] when your Lord declared that He would surely [continue to] send upon them until the Day of Resurrection those who would afflict them with the worst torment. Indeed, your Lord is swift in penalty; but indeed, He is Forgiving and Merciful.", "(168) And We divided them throughout the earth into nations. Of them some were righteous, and of them some were otherwise. And We tested them with good [times] and bad that perhaps they would return [to obedience].", "(169) And there followed them successors who inherited the Scripture [while] taking the commodities[414] of this lower life and saying, \"It will be forgiven for us.\" And if an offer like it[415] comes to them, they will [again] take it. Was not the covenant of the Scripture [i.e., the Torah] taken from them that they would not say about Allāh except the truth, and they studied what was in it? And the home of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allāh, so will you not use reason?", "(170) But those who hold fast to the Book [i.e., the Qur’ān] and establish prayer - indeed, We will not allow to be lost the reward of the reformers.", "(171) And [mention] when We raised the mountain above them as if it was a dark cloud and they were certain that it would fall upon them,[416] [and Allāh said], \"Take what We have given you with determination and remember what is in it that you might fear Allāh.\"", "(172) And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], \"Am I not your Lord?\" They said, \"Yes, we have testified.\" [This] - lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection, \"Indeed, we were of this unaware.\"", "(173) Or [lest] you say, \"It was only that our fathers associated [others in worship] with Allāh before, and we were but descendants after them. Then would You destroy us for what the falsifiers have done?\"", "(174) And thus do We [explain in] detail the verses, and perhaps they will return.[417]", "(175) And recite to them, [O Muḥammad], the news of him[418] to whom We gave [knowledge of] Our signs, but he detached himself from them; so Satan pursued him, and he became of the deviators.[419]", "(176) And if We had willed, We could have elevated him thereby,[420] but he adhered [instead] to the earth[421] and followed his own desire. So his example is like that of the dog: if you chase him, he pants, or if you leave him, he [still] pants. That is the example of the people who denied Our signs.[422] So relate the stories that perhaps they will give thought.", "(177) How evil an example [is that of] the people who denied Our signs and used to wrong themselves.", "(178) Whoever Allāh guides - he is the [rightly] guided; and whoever He sends astray[423] - it is those who are the losers.", "(179) And We have certainly created for Hell many of the jinn and mankind. They have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear. Those are like livestock; rather, they are more astray.[424] It is they who are the heedless.", "(180) And to Allāh belong the best names, so invoke Him by them. And leave [the company of] those who practice deviation concerning His names.[425] They will be recompensed for what they have been doing.", "(181) And among those We created is a community[426] which guides by truth and thereby establishes justice.", "(182) But those who deny Our signs - We will progressively lead them [to destruction][427] from where they do not know.", "(183) And I will give them time. Indeed, My plan is firm.", "(184) Then do they not give thought? There is in their companion [i.e., Muḥammad (ﷺ)] no madness. He is not but a clear warner.", "(185) Do they not look into the realm of the heavens and the earth and everything that Allāh has created and [think] that perhaps their appointed time has come near?

So plot against me all together; then do not give me respite.", "(56) Indeed, I have relied upon Allāh, my Lord and your Lord. There is no creature but that He holds it by its forelock [i.e., controls it]. Indeed, my Lord is on a path [that is] straight.", "(57) But if you turn away, then I have already conveyed that with which I was sent to you. My Lord will give succession to a people other than you, and you will not harm Him at all. Indeed my Lord is, over all things, Guardian.\"[560]", "(58) And when Our command came, We saved Hūd and those who believed with him, by mercy from Us; and We saved them from a harsh punishment.", "(59) And that was ʿAad, who rejected the signs of their Lord and disobeyed His messengers and followed the order of every obstinate tyrant.", "(60) And they were [therefore] followed in this world with a curse and [as well] on the Day of Resurrection.

Indeed, my Lord is near and responsive.\"", "(62) They said, \"O Ṣāliḥ, you were among us a man of promise before this. Do you forbid us to worship what our fathers worshipped?

So you would not increase me except in loss.", "(64) And O my people, this is the she-camel of Allāh - [she is] to you a sign. So let her feed upon Allāh's earth and do not touch her with harm, or you will be taken by an impending punishment.\"", "(65) But they hamstrung her, so he said, \"Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days. That is a promise not to be denied [i.e., unfailing].\"", "(66) So when Our command came, We saved Ṣāliḥ and those who believed with him, by mercy from Us, and [saved them] from the disgrace of that day.[561] Indeed, it is your Lord who is the Powerful, the Exalted in Might.", "(67) And the shriek[562] seized those who had wronged, and they became within their homes [corpses] fallen prone", "(68) As if they had never prospered therein. Unquestionably, Thamūd denied their Lord; then, away with Thamūd.", "(69) And certainly did Our messengers [i.e., angels] come to Abraham with good tidings; they said, \"Peace.\" He said, \"Peace,\" and did not delay in bringing [them] a roasted calf.", "(70) But when he saw their hands not reaching for it, he distrusted them and felt from them apprehension.[563] They said, \"Fear not.

Indeed, this is an amazing thing!\"", "(73) They said, \"Are you amazed at the decree of Allāh? May the mercy of Allāh and His blessings be upon you, people of the house. Indeed, He is Praiseworthy and Honorable.\"", "(74) And when the fright had left Abraham and the good tidings had reached him, he began to argue [i.e., plead] with Us[566] concerning the people of Lot.", "(75) Indeed, Abraham was forbearing, grieving[567] and [frequently] returning [to Allāh].", "(76) [The angels said], \"O Abraham, give up this [plea].

Upon Him I have relied, and to Him I return.[574]", "(89) And O my people, let not [your] dissension from me cause you to be struck by that similar to what struck the people of Noah or the people of Hūd or the people of Ṣāliḥ.

Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not have taken his brother within the religion [i.e., law] of the king except that Allāh willed. We raise in degrees whom We will, but over every possessor of knowledge is one [more] knowing.[609]", "(77) They said, \"If he steals - a brother of his has stolen before.\" But Joseph kept it within himself and did not reveal it to them.[610] He said, \"You are worse in position, and Allāh is most knowing of what you describe.\"", "(78) They said, \"O ʿAzeez,[611] indeed he has a father [who is] an old man, so take one of us in place of him.

If you had looked at them, you would have turned from them in flight and been filled by them with terror.", "(19) And similarly,[782] We awakened them that they might question one another. Said a speaker from among them, \"How long have you remained [here]?\" They said, \"We have remained a day or part of a day.\" They said, \"Your Lord is most knowing of how long you remained.
